# Juice Tech Test

## Getting setup
First, clone this repository.

Then, change into the cloned directory and start a web server. You can use any web server of your choice or you can use the one provided.
   - To use the provided web server:
     - `npm install`
     - `npm run start`
     - Go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## Taking the test
The test has been broken up into two parts: the frontend and the backend. 
Submit one [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for each of the parts - so one PR for the frontend exercise and one PR for the backend exercise.

#### Frontend Exercise
With the web server running, access [http://localhost:8080/frontend.html](http://localhost:8080/frontend.html) and follow the instructions listed there.

#### Backend Exercise
With the web server running, access [http://localhost:8080/backend.html](http://localhost:8080/backend.html) and follow the instructions listed there.

#### Timing
You have up to 2 days to complete both the Frontend and Backend exercises. We don't anticipate the exercises taking the whole 2 days but do understand that your days may be filled with other things. You can submit your changes as and when they are ready even if it's before the allocated 2 days.
