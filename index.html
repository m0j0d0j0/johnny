      <h1>Juice Tech Test</h1>   

      <h2>Taking the test</h2>
      <p>The test has been broken up into two parts: the frontend and the backend.</p>
      <p>Submit one <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/">Pull Request</a> for each of the parts - so one PR for the frontend exercise and one PR for the backend exercise.</p>

      <h4>Frontend Exercise</h4>
      <p>With the web server running, access <a href="/frontend.html" target="_blank">this page</a> and follow the instructions listed there.</p>

      <h4>Backend Exercise</h4>
      <p>With the web server running, access <a href="/backend.html" target="_blank">this page</a> and follow the instructions listed there.</p>

      <h4>Timing</h4>
      <p>You have up to 2 days to complete both the Frontend and Backend exercises. We don't anticipate the exercises taking the whole 2 days but do understand that your days may be filled with other things. You can submit your changes as and when they are ready even if it's before the allocated 2 days.</p>
